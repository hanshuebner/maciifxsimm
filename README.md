# Macintosh IIfx 16 MB SIMM

This SIMM PCB is to be populated with KM41C16000CK chips.

UNTESTED, please don't produce PCBs based on this (yet).

## Fabrication Notes

When you send the board out for fabrication, please specify a board
thickness of 1.2mm instead of the more common 1.6mm thickness. This
will ensure that the SIMM will fit correctly in the sockets.

Since the components are packed relatively close together, they can be
difficult to solder by hand. I recommend using a solder stencil and a
reflow process.
